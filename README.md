This is my personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my professional and bootcamp projects, skills, and contact information.

## Overview

The website highlights:

- Professional and bootcamp projects with live demos and GitHub links
- About Me section
- Contact form with social links and resume download
- Light/Dark mode toggle for user preference

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 & CSS3 (mostly inline styles, can be externalized)
- JavaScript (vanilla for interactivity)
- Font Awesome icons
- Formspree for form handling

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

This site is hosted via GitHub Pages, which has limitations for setting certain HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS preload, COOP, X-Frame-Options). If migrated to a custom server (e.g., Vercel or Netlify), these will be added via headers configuration.
